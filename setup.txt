- Config in Expo
  . Google Expo Application Service (EAS): Need to go through all doc.
  . In app.json (We can find the doc in Expo SDK section of EAS)\
    {
        "expo": {
            "name": "My Recipe Book",
            // slug: Friendly url name for publishing. In expo app, it is important.
            // expo.dev/@project-owner/myAppName
            "slug": "react-native-redux-context_api-6",
             // version: versioning our app which is communicating with different versions
             // might be deployed (It is user-based version)
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "orientation": "portrait",
            "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
            "userInterfaceStyle": "light",
            "splash": {
            "image": "./assets/splash.png",
            "resizeMode": "contain",
            "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
            },
            // expo allow us to update without version update
            "updates": {
                "fallbackToCacheTimeout": 0
            },
            "assetBundlePatterns": [
            "**/*"
            ],
            "ios": {
                // ios version (internal)
                "buildNumber": "1.1.0",
                "supportsTablet": true
            },
            "android": {
                // android version (internal)
                "versionCode": 1,
                "adaptiveIcon": {
                    "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
                    "backgroundColor": "#FFFFFF"
                }
            },
            "web": {
            "favicon": "./assets/favicon.png"
            }
        }
    }

    . Environment Variables and Secrets??
    . Splash Screen and icon setup setup
      We can replace any png files to adaptive-icon.png, favicon.png, icon.png, and splash.png

- Building app. (EAS Build part in doc):https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/
  . Create an expo account at https://expo.dev/signup

  . sudo npm install -g eas-cli in terminal
  . eas login in terminal
  . Under project, in terminal, eas build:configure
    Automatically generate expo project: yes
    Platform: all
  . Then we can find `eas.json` file in the project tree.
  . Before `Run Build`, please test as followed.
    1) Building APKs for Android emulators and devices
      In eas.json,
        {
            "cli": {
                "version": ">= 5.2.0"
            },
            "build": {
                "development": {
                "developmentClient": true,
                "distribution": "internal"
                },
                "preview": {
                    // For android APKs testing
                    "android" : {
                        "buildType": "apk"
                    },
                    "distribution": "internal"
                },
                "production": {}
            },
            "submit": {
                "production": {}
            }
        }

       In terminal, eas build -p android --profile preview
        - What would you like your Android application id to be? com.companyname.projectname
            Then it will create ""package": "com.joonseo.an.reactnativereduxcontext_api6"" in app.json.
        - Generate an Android Keystore: generating key for author or publisher. Say `yes`
            It will take a long time.
            After keystore, it will give us the link or QR code.
            If we have error or fail we need to visit expo login and see what happened (dependency problems)
        - Visit Expo Website 
          In Builds selection we can find "Build artifact". Find three dot icon and find "download"
        - Open Android emulator and drag and drop the downloaded file to android emulator screen.
        - Visit all app screens and we can find MyRecipe app.

        ** There is aab file to test the app in google store but we need to pay.
           (We can find guideline in the doc)

        2) Building iOS

        In eas.json,
        {
            "cli": {
                "version": ">= 5.2.0"
            },
            "build": {
                "development": {
                "developmentClient": true,
                "distribution": "internal"
                },
                "preview": {
                    // For android APKs testing
                    "android" : {
                        "buildType": "apk"
                    },
                    "ios": {
                        "simulator": true
                    },
                    "distribution": "internal"
                },
                "production": {}
            },
            "submit": {
                "production": {}
            }
        }

        (Open ios simulator first)
        eas build -p ios --profile preview
        What would you like your iOS bundle identifier to be? com.joonseo.an.reactnativereduxcontext
        Do you want to log in to your Apple account? › (Y/n) n
        Then, it finally gives us link : https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/vPEMm5QxMCA794nrWsGrmX.tar.gz 
        (For Android, we can find the link just in case in Expo website)
         Install and run the iOS build on a simulator? …y --> Finally install the app to simulator
       

- production app: need to pay!!!
